article_1 = '''With lush, unadulterated foliage and the May River hugging its perimeter, Palmetto Bluff epitomizes South Carolina’s lowcountry. For many, the region’s serene surroundings is a world’s away from New York’s chaotic, concrete jungle. However, this vacation home defies traditional southern living, proving the city and country can live together in perfect harmony.

From the moment she met her clients—a family of four who live full-time in New York City—designer Cortney Bishop knew this vacation home would bridge the gap between city and country.  

“They had that New York sophistication, but with a very hospitable, Southern flair, too,” she  explains. “I just kind of immediately got a grasp of [their] innate style.”

For the husband wife behind the project, this vacation house is more than an escape from the hustle and bustle of New York City; it’s somewhere the couple can entertain and expose their two children to their Southern roots. But while reconnecting with their upbringing was important, Bishop deftly interpreted the couple’s sleek, metropolitan style to fit in with their lowcountry environment. 

“It’s a relaxed home, but it’s still their style,” she says. “A little bit of edge, a little bit of jewelry, just something a little bit more fabulous.”

A careful balance between classic and contemporary was at the core of this home, long before the clients met Bishop. First, the clients enlisted Pearce Scott Architects to build the home and an accompanying carriage house. For Pearce Scott and Amanda Jackson, who oversaw the completion of the main house, it was important to strike a balance between old and new. 

“They wanted something a little edgy, so we pulled from history and [the lowcountry’s] traditional tobacco barn form,” Scott says. “We were trying to find a play with multiple historical references to do something contemporary.” 

The Bluffton-based architecture worked with construction CS Thompson to fill the home with modern elements such as steel windows and tabby lifts. 

Even though the vacation home pays homage to the region’s rich  history, the space’s modern, metropolitan attitude is proudly on display from the moment guests step in the foyer. Bishop redefined southern hospitality by fashioning marble slabs into a traditional, checkerboard floor tile. The overscale shiplap that lines the entryway and many other rooms in the house boast a 90-degree angle and quarter-inch reveal, giving this southern staple a fresh spin. 

Bishop rounded out the entryway with a rug she found in Morocco and an oversized painting by one of her Belgian friends, bringing New York City’s melting pot mentality to the lowcountry. 

“It shows their playfulness and offers a sense of landing,” Bishop explains. “It shows approachability and classic style, but it’s unique, interesting, and juxtaposes modern and traditional. That character plays throughout the whole house.” 

While the home’s open-concept floorplan caters to the family’s plans to entertain, the kitchen is the heart of the home, bringing that New York sensibility front and center. 

The slim cabinets that reach the ceiling offer some drama to the space, while the earthy green paint and brass hardware support the home’s warm, welcoming atmosphere. And the extravagant, tabby-clad fireplace across from the kitchen—which Bishop says has the formality of a New York City penthouse—is backed by a wall of sizeable shiplap. 

“I knew they wanted that classic Charleston, but we had to edge it up a little bit and we had to make it a little more refined,” she explains. “You have this traditional luxe meets Charleston beach house, which brings out their personality to the next level.” 

Just how the concrete jungle completes New York City’s high-rises and brownstones, Palmetto Bluff’s lush landscape is integral to this vacation home. Bishop deftly added colors, patterns, and textures to the home that celebrate the home’s surroundings, not compete with them. The interior designer stuck with a color palette of “earthy jewels,” a collection of moss greens, moody mahogany, and a deep teal that adorns the home office. Throughout the home, resilient materials like steel, stone, and marble are undercut with sofas coated in Verellen’s woven upholstery and airy drapes by Zak + Fox, mimicking the softness of the trees and marsh outside.

But no room strikes a balance between indoors and outdoors like the kitchen’s adjoining breakfast nook, which has become one of the clients’ favorite design moments. 

“There wasn’t much bold color going on here that shocks you,” Bishop adds. “It was intentionally selected to not distract you from what we were seeing outside that breakfast nook or what we know to be in the surrounding area.”

With sun-drenched metal windows, a custom dining table by Jacob May, and the marble checkered tile from the foyer, this breakfast nook encourages the clients and their guests to stop and appreciate the view.

article_2 = '''We’re not going to sugarcoat it for you: Moving in with your significant other isn’t always easy. Between divvying up the chores, scoring some alone time, and dealing with each other’s foibles, cohabiting with another person (especially the person you love) requires a lot of patience and compromise. 

As if that isn’t challenging enough, many people are suddenly working from home—right next to their partner. Spending every waking (and, honestly sleeping) moment with your significant sounds like a lot of quality time, but when you factor in your to-do list, string of deadlines, and inevitable work stress? Well, we finally understand what Pat Benatar meant by love is a battlefield.  Ugh.

But just because you’re cooped up with your partner for the foreseeable future doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed. To help, several relationship experts shared their tips on how to make cohabiting and coworking more manageable. Fortunately, you don’t have to be in a relationship to learn something new. You can also apply these tips to sheltering in place with your roommate, best friend, or family members.

Start the Day on the Right Foot

Once upon a time—you know, back when you didn’t work from home— it’s likely you and your significant other had a structured morning routine. Chances are, you knew when you had to wake up, who needed the bathroom first, and who was responsible for making the coffee. 

But, as most of us are hitting the snooze button more times than we’d like to admit and clocking into work the moment we wake up, it’s possible your morning routine has been thrown out the window.  Translation? Since your day is starting in chaos, it’s all too easy to wake up already annoyed at your significant other. 

According to relationship expert Glennon Gordon,  it’s important to start the day on a positive note.

“Make it a point to begin your day with a positive intention toward your spouse or partner,” she says. “If we start off our day viewing our significant other in a positive light versus a negative one, our chances of harmonious living will increase.”
As Gordon puts it, simply acknowledging that your partner is ultimately your teammate and doing their best during this time can help you stay grounded and positive throughout the day.

Share Your Schedule

Just because you’re working from home doesn’t mean you’ve put your hustle on hold. Many people are still clocking in a full workday, complete with deadlines and conference calls. Very few things can derail your own productivity—or, honestly, grind your gears—like having your partner try to make small talk throughout the day. 

Want to complete your to do list without losing your cool? Whether you have a big conference call that requires no interruptions or are on deadline, share your schedule with your partner. 

“When we ask for what we need, we give our partner a clear roadmap for how to best support us and show us love,” says Chanel Doku, relationship expert and co-founder of Healthy Minds NYC. 

Another way to master the work-life balance is to establish working hours. 

“Delay personal conversations until you’re outside the work window,” Doku adds. “Knowing the edges of personal and professional time can help you avoid the compounding stress that comes from mixing personal irritations with work frustrations.” 

Does work begin when you sit down and first open your laptop? Is the workday over when your partner officially kicks off happy hour with that bottle of Chardonnay at 6 p.m.? Creating a schedule—and sticking to it—can help you set boundaries with your relationship and job. 

Declare Your Independence 

Nowadays, scoring some alone time feels virtually impossible. Afterall, you sleep in the same bed, watch TV from the same couch, and likely work from the same dining room table. However, it’s more important than ever to dedicate some time to yourself. 

“Go on walks or bike rides alone or download an app to give yourself some space to do a workout alone,” says Courtney Quinlan, founder and owner of Midwestern Matchmaking. “Go into a separate room and spend at least 30 minutes doing an activity to get your mind off of the stressors in life, work, and your partner.”

Quinlan recommends reading a book, watching your favorite TV show, or doodling in an adult coloring book. If you’re living in tight quarters, put in your headphones and listen to an audiobook or podcast. That way, you can have some alone time without leaving your home. 

Take a (Virtual) Break

Regardless of how much you love your significant other, it’s possible to get irritated with anyone after spending too much time with them. If working and living with your significant other is becoming too much, create some breathing space by calling a friend or family member. 

“Social distancing doesn’t have to mean social isolation and remaining connected with your friends and family is important now more than ever,” says Kristin Anderson, an associate psychotherapist at NYC Therapy + Wellness. “Making an effort to stay in touch and communicate with people you aren’t [living] with can help relieve that stress on your relationship.”

Not only does this give you the time to recharge, but it’s also a great excuse to connect with your loved ones.

Psst…did somebody say virtual happy hour? Try these delicious cocktail recipes.

Keep the Romance Alive

Let’s be honest: It can be hard to keep the spark alive when you’re spending every single minute with your significant other. We mean, who wants to turn up the romance when your partner’s obnoxiously loud chewing is driving you crazy? However, it’s important to show your significant other some extra love. 

“Do small, everyday gestures for your partner,” says Viktor Sander, a counselor at SocialPro.  “Take five minutes every day to do something out of the ordinary for your partner. It could be something as simple as doing one of their normal chores for them or preparing a small dessert after dinner.”

In addition to putting a smile on your significant other’s face, these small romantic gestures will help lay the groundwork for putting your relationship first.

Communication is Key 

Between the never-ending news cycle, daily stresses from work, and feeling that cabin fever finally sink in, you and your significant other are dealing with a lot these days. Of course, spending day in and day out in such a small space isn’t helping. It’s all too easy to internalize your frustrations, only to blow up at the smallest hiccup or disagreement. However, it’s important to keep the lines of communication open.

“Couples likely express stress in different ways and at different times,” Gordon says. “Hold
space for each other and vent as necessary or ask for help with solutions if that’s what you’re looking for.” 

Simply start by asking your how their day was or how they’re handling your newfound coworking setup. Instead of hopping to the defense, keep the conversation thoughtful, calm, and collaborative.

“By prioritizing your relationship during this heightened time of anxiety you may come out stronger and actually have your improved relationship be the silver lining of this difficult time,” she says.

Your coworking setup may not be ideal but, like most sticky situations, this too shall pass.

article_3 = '''This may be the new normal for quite a while.

The US may have to endure social distancing measures -- such as stay-at-home orders and school closures -- until 2022, researchers projected on Tuesday. That is, unless, a vaccine becomes quickly available.
That's according to researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who published their findings in the journal Science on Tuesday. Those findings directly contradict research being touted by the White House that suggests the pandemic may stop this summer.
Long-term social distancing may be traumatic. Here is what to expect and what to do 
Long-term social distancing may be traumatic. Here is what to expect and what to do
The team at the Harvard School of Public Health used what's known about Covid-19 and other coronaviruses to create possible scenarios of the current pandemic.
"Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available," they wrote in their report. "Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024."
The Harvard team's projections also indicate that the virus would come roaring back fairly quickly once restrictions were lifted.
"If intermittent distancing is the approach that's chosen, it may be necessary to do it for several years, which is obviously a very long time," Dr. Marc Lipsitch, an author on the study and an epidemiology professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, told reporters.
Another important factor: Whether people become immune to the new coronavirus after they have been infected. That's not yet known.
Potential challenges include finding a reliable test to determine who has antibodies for the coronavirus, establishing the level of immunity conferred by previous infection and how long it lasts, and the capacity of overstretched health systems to carry out reliable, widespread antibody tests in the general population.
There's also the difficult social questions around immunity certificates, which have been floated as a possibility in the UK. Would they create a kind of two-tier society, where those who have them can return to a more normal life, while others remain locked down?
The study researchers say they are aware that such prolonged distancing, even if intermittent, would likely have "profoundly negative economic, social, and educational consequences."
They hope their research will help identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches, identify complementary ways to fight it, and to spur further thinking about ways to get the pandemic under control.
Though coronavirus cases in the US have been soaring, social distancing appears to be effective.
Social distancing is "one of the most powerful weapons" against COVID-19, said Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"If we can just maximize that social distancing, we can limit this virus's ability," he said earlier this month.
How social distancing fines are working, or not working, across America
How social distancing fines are working, or not working, across America
States across the country have issued stay-at-home orders, allowing only for essential errands or tasks.
Penalties for breaking the order vary by state. In Maine, the penalty for breaking the order can be up to six months in jail and up to a $1,000 fine.
In Florida, a pastor was arrested last month for continuing to hold large services and is charged with unlawful assembly and violation of public health emergency rules, both second-degree misdemeanors.
This week, states on the East and West coasts announced they are forming their own regional pacts to work together on how to reopen after the stay-at-home orders.
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts each plan to name a public health and economic official to a regional working group.
West Coast states of California, Washington and Oregon also announced they are joining forces in a plan to begin incremental release of stay-at-home orders.'''

article_4 = '''(CNN)More than 90% of the US population is currently under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order as the coronavirus pandemic continues to upend life as we know it. But worries for the economy -- and people's mental health -- are raising the question: When will things go back to normal?

While President Donald Trump has leaned into his desire to reopen the nation's economy by May 1, many of the nation's governors and mayors who hold the power to enforce closures seem to disagree.
Along with expanding testing and tracing, governors across the country are highlighting the importance of using science and advice from health officials rather than politics to choose when to reopen the economy.
Here's the latest on where states stand in their plan to reopen:
Alabama
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey issued a stay-at-home order set to expire on April 30.
Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth announced the formation of a task force to reopen the state's economy. A plan will be presented to Ivey by April 17, he said.
"We have an emergency small business task force and we have a subcommittee that's going to have recommendations ... that's going to look at all of the nonessential businesses plus any business that's been impacted, talking about how we can get them back open for business May 1st," Ainsworth said.
The state will find the best way to ease restrictions on restaurants and stores while continuing to incorporate social distancing needs.
When the economy starts to open up, Ivey said during a Monday press briefing it will be a slow process over time, "segment by segment or region by region."
Alaska
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy ordered its residents to stay at home unless absolutely necessary, starting March 28, and will remain in effect until rescinded.
Dunleavy plans on reopening the state as early as next week.
"We're constantly checking the pulse of this whole pandemic to see when we can open things up," Dunleavy said during the latest Covid-19 Alaska press conference on Friday.
Since testing availability has increased, the governor is confident that if Alaska can "get the right tools in the right time," the state will be a "model of success."
Arizona
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order which will expire on April 30 unless extended.
"I want to get the economy moving and people back to work as soon as possible -- when it is safe and healthy for people to do so," Ducey said on Twitter on Monday.
The governor emphasized the importance of maintaining social distancing and continuing to make "responsible choices."
"It's critical that we keep those efforts up as we plan for the future and a time when we can begin to return some normalcy to people's lives," Ducey said.
Arkansas
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has yet to issue a stay-at-home order to his citizens as a way to limit the spread of coronavirus nationwide.
"We want to take the long-term approach to this and you're not going to win simply by a lockdown," Hutchinson explained to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, adding: "There's a lot of hope and optimism this Easter that our tough time is behind and we're going to be getting better."
Schools will be closed for the rest of the academic term. Fitness centers, bars, restaurants and other public spaces are closed until further notice.
California
California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19 that has no set end date.
Newsom announced a joint Western States Pact with Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on April 13.
"Health outcomes and science -- not politics -- will guide these decisions" to reopen the states, according to a joint statement from the governors.
Newsom outlined a framework for reopening the economy in the Golden State on Tuesday that he said was predicated on the state's ability to do six things: expand testing to identify and isolate the infected, maintain vigilance to protect seniors and high risk individuals, be able to meet future surges in hospitals with a "myriad of protective gear," continue to collaborate with academia on therapies and treatments, redraw regulations to ensure continued physical distancing at businesses and schools and develop new enforcement mechanisms to allow the state to pull back and reinstate stay-at-home orders.
"I know you want the timeline, but we can't get ahead of ourselves and dream of regretting. Let's not make the mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we want to," Newsom said.
Colorado
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis extended the state's stay-at-home order, which now remains in effect until April 26.
"I can't stress enough the importance of staying home during these next few weeks," Polis said in a news release. "We have to keep this up for a little while longer in order to return to a level of normalcy in our economy and our society."
The governor said he hoped the state would be able to open up on April 26 when the stay at home order expires as long as residents are staying home and wearing masks when they go out. However, he stressed that opening in early May did not mean "things are going to go back to how they were in terms of 60,000 people in a stadium (or) a busy nightclub."
Polis also said he would welcome a regional or national approach to a time on when to reopen.
Connecticut
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont extended the mandatory shutdown in the state until May 20.
Connecticut has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a news release from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
Lamont said he believed it would take at least another month before the state could make a decision on how and when to open things back up and emphasized "this is no time to relax."
Delaware
Delaware Gov. John Carney issued a statewide stay-at-home order that will remain until May 15 or until the "public health threat is eliminated."
Delaware has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
Florida
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order for Floridians until April 30.
The governor did not close down the state's beaches as spring breakers partied last month, has not approved retroactive unemployment benefits for those who have lost their jobs and continues to push hydroxychloroquine, a still unproven drug to treat coronavirus.
DeSantis is considering re-opening schools in the state, falsely claiming the coronavirus hasn't killed anyone under 25.
Georgia
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a statewide shelter-in-place order that runs until April 30. The governor also extended the public health emergency through May 13. All K-12 public schools will remain closed through the end of the school year.
Kemp emphasized the importance of expanding testing before reopening the state.
"We're a little behind the curve from when our peak is going to be to other states around the country," Kemp said during Monday's press briefing. "That is certainly a day I am ready for, but I think today specifically we have been focused on the surge capacity, ramping up testing to do more than we're doing."
Hawaii
Hawaii Gov. David Ige issued a stay-at-home order for Hawaii residents which will last through at least April 30.
Ige has not made any statements on reopening Hawaii at this point in time.
Idaho
Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued a stay at home order on March 25 and an extreme emergency declaration, which will remain in effect until April 15 unless extended.
"Governor Little and public health officials will evaluate later whether to extend the order past 21 days," the press release about the stay at home order said.
"Nobody wants to open up the economy more than I do, so that's our goal," Little said, according to KTVB Idaho.
"What I don't want to have is open it up and then have us go back to what we were worried about."
Illinois
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home order for the entire state which extends through at least April 30.
Pritzker said during a press briefing Monday that he believes the current state in Illinois has been enough to slowly start lifting shelter-in-place orders so that some industry workers can go back to work.
Although there is no clear time line, he hopes that restarting production will go "industry by industry, and maybe company by company."
Indiana
Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a stay-at-home order for the state through April 20, but it may be extended.
While Holcomb hopes loosen up restrictions, he emphasized that he is still encouraging people to continue staying home and practicing social distancing.
"We have managed our resources well and we find ourselves in a position to where we can care for those in need," Holcomb said during the press briefing on Monday. "What we don't want to do is prematurely loosen up."
Holcomb mentioned the "new normal" after restrictions are loosened may include new measures such as taking employees temperature at work, wearing masks, and physical distancing.
Iowa
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has not declared a stay-at-home order. Reynolds issued a State of Public Health Disaster Emergency on March 17, ordering all nonessential businesses to close until April 30.
The governor formed an Iowa economic recovery task force consisting of state leaders and private business leaders and announced plans to discuss with education leaders about the possibility of reopening schools.
"We will recover. I want to open up this state as soon as we can, but I want to do it in a responsible manner," Reynolds said Monday. "I don't want to open it up just to have to shut things back down again. We want to be very consistent and have to rely on some data to do that."
Kansas
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly issued a stay-at-home order which will remain in effect until April 19.
The governor said during a press briefing on Friday that she is considering extending the order and will address it this week.
"My guess is, yes we will extend it but we don't know the details right now," Kelly said.
Kentucky
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued a "Healthy at Home" order on March 25 that will be in effect indefinitely.
Beshear has not made decision on when to reopen the state. He has recommended that school districts statewide extend the suspension of in-person classes until at least May 1. Though he said a decision would be made next week, at a press conference Tuesday, Beshear said, "schools should at least prepare for plans of not being open for the rest of the year."
During a press conference in late March, Beshear said he would base his decision for reopening the state on "hard data and facts" and would be guided by "Dr. Fauci" and other health professionals.
Louisiana
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 30.
Edwards said he would announce later this week an economic resiliency recovery task force that will advise on what the next steps the state should take.
"This is going to be done in some sort of a transition and we're going to be doing it that way here in Louisiana," Edwards said during Monday's press briefing. "I cannot tell you exactly what that's going to look like yet, but we will be working really hard with all of the experts to get that figured out. "
Maine
Maine Gov. Janet Mills issued a "Stay Healthy at Home" executive order through at least April 30. Mills extended the state's civil state of emergency until May 15.
"We are in the midst of one of the greatest public health crises this world has seen in more than a century," Mills said in a news release. "This virus will continue to sicken people across our state; our cases will only grow, and more people will die. I say this to be direct, to be as honest with you as I can. Because saving lives will depend on us."
Mills said she wished she didn't have to extend the state of emergency, but "the continued spread of the virus demands a sustained response by the State."
Maryland
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 30. There is no current potential end date.
The governor said during his appearance on CNN Newsroom on Monday that the state is discussing ways to safely reopening the state with health officials, and that his priority is to save lives, not the economy.
"We've got to listen to the doctors and scientists," Hogan said. "We've also got to be concerned about people getting the help they need and getting on track, but doing so in a gradual and safe manner when it's really the right time to do it."
Hogan said a cooperation amongst other governors on when to reopen the states would be a "good idea."
Massachusetts
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker issued an emergency order requiring all nonessential businesses to close facilities until May 4.
Massachusetts has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
Baker told residents of his state that officials have begun conversations around reopening the state but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done before a plan is set into motion.
The state will need to have testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine procedures in place to reopen, the governor said.
"I think it's going to be really important that we all pay attention to what the others are up to, and to make sure that nobody does anything that puts somebody in a really bad spot, because they just weren't thinking about what that impact was going to be on some other part of the Northeastern part of the US," he said.
Michigan
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 30.
Whitmer said during Monday's press briefing that reopening the state's economy will be based on a "data-driven approach based on facts, based on science, based on recommendations from experts."
The four factors the governor will take into consideration before reopening Michigan include a sustained reduction in cases, expanded testing and tracing capabilities, sufficient healthcare capacity, and the best practices for the workplace.
Minnesota
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 3.
He also signed an executive order extending the peacetime emergency for an additional 30 days until May 13.
Walz emphasized the importance of expanding testing and tracing the spread of the virus before opening the state.
The governor's plan to open up the economy is to "test, we have to do contact tracing, and we have to isolate the people who need to be isolated, and this has to be on a massive scale," Walz said.
Mississippi
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a shelter-in-place order which expires on April 20. The governor announced on Tuesday that schools will remain closed for the rest of the semester.
Reeves said the state needed to open things back up as quickly and as responsibly as possible.
"We know that we will not be able to return to our typical lives right away," Reeves said during Monday's press briefing.
"There are still more sacrifices to be made. We do want to look ahead to opening things up, I know that there are many Mississippians whose lives and livelihoods rely on our ability to get them back to work in a responsible way."
Missouri
Missouri Gov. Mike Parson issued a statewide "Stay Home Missouri" order through April 24. Parson has made no plans to reopen the state.
Montana
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 24.
Bullock held a governor's coronavirus task force tele-town hall for Montanans on Monday in which he said following the state's guidelines will allow the state to reopen sooner rather than later.
Bullock said he does not know when the stay at home order will be lifted and that while he doesn't "want to have it in place any longer than what's necessary," he is more concerned about completely reopening the state and jeopardizing the work that has been done.
Nebraska
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts issued the "21 Days to Stay Home and Stay Healthy" campaign on April 10. Ricketts ordered that all hair salons, tattoo parlors and strip clubs be closed through May 31.
Nebraska is one of the states that has not issued a stay-at-home order to limit the spread of coronavirus nationwide. Ricketts has not made any plans to reopen the state.
The state's campaign is based on six rules: staying home, socially distancing at work, shopping alone and only once a week, helping kids social distance, helping seniors stay at home and exercising at home.
Nevada
Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak formally issued a stay-at-home order which will last until April 30.
When asked about how he'd make his decision to reopen the economy, Sisolak said "positive testing is important but it's not my number one parameter."
"The things that I look at on a daily basis are hospitalizations, intensive care unit hospitalizations, ventilator usage, and people who pass," Sisolak added.
New Hampshire
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu issued a stay-at-home order until May 4.
Sununu told reporters in late March he wants to open the economy as soon as possible, but would not prioritize it over the health of his citizens.
"What we are not going to do is overly accelerate or loosen regulations just for the sake of the economy at the risk of public health," Sununu said.
New Jersey
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy issued a stay-at-home order on March 21 which has no specific end date.
New Jersey has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
"No one has given more thought or is more eager to restart our economy than I am, but if we don't get the sequencing right, we put more lives at risk. The only path to a sustainable economic recovery is through a strong healthcare recovery," Murphy said in a news release.
"A coordinated, regional approach, informed by a multi-state council of experts, will help us avoid a major setback with potentially disastrous consequences."
New Mexico
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham extended the state's emergency order to April 30.
The governor said she would do "what's best for New Mexico" but won't be able to find out when the state could reopen without expanding testing capabilities.
"If we had better national strategies and universal testing and software-based contract tracing, then we could really figure out when opening makes sense and we could start to do that in the country," Grisham said.
The governor added that the state has been looking at different recovery options but won't take any actions until the peak occurs.
New York
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a "New York State on PAUSE" executive order which took effect on March 22. Schools and nonessential businesses are ordered to stay closed until April 29.
New York has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
The governor has not come to any decision on when businesses will reopen and said he rejected "any elected official or any expert who says I can tell you what's going to happen four weeks from today."
North Carolina
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a stay-at-home order for the state effective until April 29.
The governor said that the more people adhere to social distancing requirements in April, the sooner the state will loosen restrictions.
"We have a team examining how North Carolina can emerge with the right practices in place to keep us healthy and strong and ready to jump start our economy," Cooper said in Monday's press briefing.
"We're considering the most effective ways to modify executive orders to help boost the economy while continuing to prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients."
North Dakota
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has only shut down schools, restaurants, fitness centers, movie theaters and salons. Burgum declared a state of emergency on March 13.
North Dakota is one of the states that has yet to issue a stay-at-home order to limit the spread of coronavirus nationwide.
Burgum has not discussed fully reopening closed business and schools.
Ohio
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine issued a statewide stay-at-home order lasting which will remain in place until May 1.
"I would not be making these decisions if it wasn't a matter of life and death," DeWine said in a news release. "We have to keep this monster down. It's not dead -- it's very much alive."
Along with loosening restrictions, DeWine told CNN that citizens would have to feel confident about going out without being afraid and the only way to reach that point was to significantly expand testing.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has issued a statewide "Safer at Home" order for adults over the age of 65 and other vulnerable residents until April 30.
Stitt said the state would have to ease into reopening the economy.
Oregon
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown issued an executive order directing Oregonians to stay at home on March 23 that "remains in effect until ended by the Governor."
Brown announced a joint Western States Pact with California Governor Gavin Newsom and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on April 13.
In terms of the timeline for reopening the states, the statement says the state will "need to see a decline in the rate of spread of the virus before large-scale reopening, and we will be working in coordination to identify the best metrics to guide this."
Brown said she would not ease restrictions before seeing five components in place: declining growth rate of active vases, sufficient personal protective equipment, surge capacity in hospitals, increased test capacity, contact tracing and isolating positive cases, and strategies to protect vulnerable communities.
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania Gov. Tim Wolf issued stay-at-home orders across the state until April 30.
Pennsylvania has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
"Every time we talk about opening something up, we're going to be prolonging this phase," Wolf told reporters on Friday.
"If it's not in the best interests of keeping people safe, I'm not going to go along with it."
Rhode Island
Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo issued an emergency declaration extending the state's stay-at-home order to last until May 8.
Rhode Island has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.
To reopen the state, Raimondo said there would need to be advanced testing and contact tracing put in place.
"It is clear that what you're doing is working," Raimondo said, referring to residents staying at home. "It's keeping you safer. It's keeping Rhode Islanders safer. And quite frankly it's making it so I can really start thinking about reopening this economy sooner rather than later."
South Carolina
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster extended his previous "State of Emergency" executive order through at least April 27.
"We want to get all these businesses going back as soon as we can," McMaster said during Monday's press briefing.
"And to that end, we will be announcing before long, a plan, a rejuvenation plan, a revitalization plan in order to get our economy started again."

Texas
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered all Texans to stay home through April 30.
The governor said during Monday's press briefing that only businesses "that will have minimal or zero impact" on the spread of the coronavirus will be the first to open up.
"This is not going to be a rush the gates everybody is able to suddenly reopen all at once," Abbott said. "We have to understand that we must reopen in a way in which we are able to stimulate the economy while at the very same time ensuring that we contain the spread of COVID-19."
Abbott will outline strategies to begin the process of reopening the economy later in the week, he said.
Utah
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert extended the state's "Stay Safe, Stay Home" directive through May 1. Schools will be closed for the remainder of the year.
Utah is one of the states that has yet to issue a stay-at-home order to limit the spread of coronavirus nationwide.
Herbert also issued an executive order Thursday requiring adults entering the state to disclose their travel plans.
"We are seeing encouraging evidence that our efforts to stay home are making a difference," Herbert said in a news release.
"We cannot let up on these measures. Working together, we can slow the spread of coronavirus, alleviate the stress on our health systems, and get Utahns back to work and to a level of normalcy more quickly."
Herbert said the state is making plans for how and when restrictions will be lifted, but continued to urge citizens to stay home.
Vermont
Vermont Gov. Gov. Phil Scott issued a "Stay Home, Stay Safe" order which has been extended until May 15.
"It didn't take federal action to spur us into action and it's not going to be the federal government that's gong to determine when we take appropriate steps here in Vermont," Scott said during Monday's press conference.
Scott said reopening the state would take time, but the priority was listening to experts and continuing to save lives by asking people to stay home.
"We are making big sacrifices to save lives, but we cannot let our foot off the gas just yet," Scott said in a news release. "We will continue to watch the trends, and as soon as the data shows a downward trend, we can open the spigot, a quarter turn at a time, to get folks back to work in a way that's responsible and safe."
Virginia
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued a stay-at-home order effective until June 10.
"We are in a public health crisis, and we need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly," Northam said in a news release. "Our message to Virginians is clear: stay home."
Northam has made it clear that the state must make decisions based on "science, public health expertise, and data," Secretary of Health and Human Resources Daniel Carey said.
Washington
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee extended Washignton's stay-at-home order until May 4, saying "We are yet to see the full toll of this virus in our state and the modeling we've seen could be much worse if we don't continue what we're doing to slow the spread."
Inslee announced a joint Western States Pact with California Governor Gavin Newsom and Oregon Governor Kate Brown on April 13th.
Before deciding on when to reopen the state, Inslee said during an interview with Katy Tur on MSNBC that there would need to be an "enormous expansions" of coronavirus testing capabilities, a way to trace the spread in communities, and "for the president to recognize that these decisions really are going to be made by governors."
West Virginia
West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice issued a stay-at-home order until further notice.
"That curve is the curve we're looking for to be able to look at the possibility of backing things off and going forward. We're not there yet," Justice said during his briefing on Monday.
Despite numbers suggesting that the state is starting to do better, Justice said it wasn't time to relax social distancing measures or asking people to stop staying home.
"I'm proud of each and every one of you so keep following the guidelines, stay at home, social distance, practice good hygiene and when the time comes, and it will, we'll cross the finish line together as West Virginians," Justice said in a news release.
Wisconsin
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a "Safer at Home" order that prohibits all nonessential travel which will remain until April 24.
The governor said the state needs to find a way to expand testing and contact tracing, especially in urban areas, before opening back up.
"In order for us to get to a place that's maybe less restrictive in the state, our public health systems are going to have to look different. We are going to need more testing," Evers said during Monday's press briefing.
Wyoming
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon submitted a request asking for a federal disaster declaration for Wyoming on April 9. Wyoming is one of the states without a stay-at-home order.
"Though Wyoming has not reached the dire situations of some states, this declaration will help us to prepare and mobilize resources when we need them," Governor Gordon said in a news release. "I look forward to a swift response to our request from the federal government."
Gordon extended statewide public health orders through April 30 and issued a directive requiring travelers to quarantine for 14 days.'''

article_5 = '''  In a phone call last week, some of the nation's top scientists briefed White House officials about antibody testing, according to two doctors who were on the call.

Much of the news wasn't very good.
Antibody tests check to see if a person has previously been infected with Covid-19, an indication that they've had the virus and now could be immune to it.
What are antibody tests and what do they mean for the coronavirus pandemic?
What are antibody tests and what do they mean for the coronavirus pandemic?
Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, has called such tests "critical."
The test can help determine if someone is immune to coronavirus, "and that's going to be important when you think about getting people back into the workplace," according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the task force.
"The antibody test says you were infected and if you're feeling well, you've very likely recovered," Fauci said. "As we look forward, as we get to the point of at least considering opening up the country as it were, it's very important to appreciate and to understand how much that virus has penetrated society."

"We have made great progress with the antibody testing, fantastic progress," Trump said at a media briefing April 5.
Five days later, Vice President Mike Pence said at a media briefing that "very soon we will have an antibody test that Americans will be able to take to determine whether they ever had the coronavirus."
But on the April 6 phone call, members of the National Academy of Sciences' Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats told members of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy there are issues with the availability and reliability of the antibody tests in the United States right now.
"In three words: Work in progress," said Dr. David Relman, a member of the National Academy of Sciences committee who was on the call.
There are several layers of issues with the antibody tests.
FDA tightens enforcement on Covid-19 antibody tests

First, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed its rules, and now companies can sell antibody tests without submitting validation data that shows they actually work.
The Association of Public Health Laboratories says that has resulted in "crappy" tests flooding the market.
"It's like the wild, wild West out there -- or wild East," said association CEO Scott Becker, a reference to the fact that at least half the companies making these tests are in China.
Becker said that in conference call Tuesday that FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said antibody tests would undergo scientific review by the National Cancer Institute.
There has been concern that some of the tests might confuse the coronavirus causing the current pandemic with one of several coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
"Lots of tests confuse the two," Relman said.

The tests would then end up telling people they had antibodies to the pandemic coronavirus when they didn't, and people might think they're immune when they're not.
A few days after the phone call, the NAS scientists wrote a letter to the White House frankly apprising them about the quality of antibody tests.
Results from antibody tests "should be viewed as suspect until rigorous controls are performed and performance characteristics described, as antibody detection methods can vary considerably, and most so far have not described well-standardized controls," according to the letter.
Second, there are good tests in the midst of the bad ones, but they're not yet widely and easily available throughout the country.
Third, it's not entirely clear that having antibodies to Covid-19 means that you truly have immunity and won't get the disease again.
"That's the $64 question," said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of the NAS committee, who was also on the phone call with the White House. "Does antibody level equate to resistance to getting ill again?"
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy did not respond to requests from CNN to describe what it learned on the April 6 call or how officials plan to use the information the scientists gave them.
Fineberg said he felt that the White House officials paid close attention on the call.
"That's the brilliance of Kelvin Droegemeier, to elicit this kind of input and turn to the academics in the first place," Fineberg said, referring to the director of the White House policy office. "They're genuinely trying to widen their aperture for advice, and I think so far it's working."
"To see this kind of engagement is very heartening," Relman added. "Does it lead to useful consequences? Does it have an impact? Does the scientific engagement end up informing policy? For that I think we have to hope and wait and see."
Fineberg added that antibody tests are important on a national scale, to gauge what proportion of the population might be immune, but also on a personal level.
"Everybody wants to know -- am I immune? Can I now visit Grandma so that I'm not a threat to her and she's not a threat to me?" he said. "How do we discern the people who can now safely go out and about? That's an important personal and social question."  '''

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott made waves during COVID-19 lockdowns after holding a social gathering over the weekend in which running back Ezekiel Elliott was reportedly present.

Speaking on 103.5 FM The Fan, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said Tuesday the team has talked to Prescott and Elliott about not conducting gatherings while most of the country remains under quarantine.

"We've certainly communicated with Dak and Zeke," Jones said, via Jon Machota of The Athletic. "And I think they're certainly aware now of how sensitive these situations are. I don't think you'll be seeing that any more. They are certainly guys that we have the utmost respect for. I certainly know they understand the sensitivity of the situation we're in, it's certainly very serious and something we know they understand."

NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport obtained a statement released by Prescott:

"I understand and accept that there are additional responsibilities and media scrutiny that come with being an NFL quarterback, but it is very frustrating and disappointing when people provide completely inaccurate information from anonymous sources, especially now," Prescott stated. "To set the record straight -- I know that we all need to do our best to socially distance and like everyone else, I am continuing to adjust to what that requires, but the truth is that I was with fewer than 10 people for a home dinner -- not a party -- on Friday night. I am very sensitive to the challenges we are all facing and making sure to support the first responders and medical personnel and everyone else putting in long hours. We are all at a time when we need to keep educating ourselves about the importance of health and isolation during this pandemic and I will continue to make sure to do my part by following the guidelines until we are approved to start returning to normal activities."

The NFL has closed facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and stressed to players to follow social distancing requirements implemented by state and local governments to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The circumstances have led to the league conducting the 2020 NFL Draft virtually and beginning a virtual workout program for teams beginning next week.  '''

article_7 = '''  Local lawmakers in San Francisco have given the mayor 12 days to secure 7,000 hotel rooms to house the city's homeless population during the coronavirus emergency, plus another 1,250 rooms for frontline workers.

The emergency ordinance passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors requires Mayor London Breed to secure the rooms by April 26 and asks her to use emergency powers to commandeer the rooms if she is unable to reach deals with hotel owners.

The vote, taken via videoconference, was a rebuke to what has until now been the mayor's more moderate strategy to place only the city's most vulnerable homeless people in hotel rooms. The legislation highlights the ongoing challenges that San Francisco and other cities face in managing large homeless populations, whose susceptibility to COVID-19 threatens broader efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

As of Tuesday, San Francisco had leased about 2,000 hotel rooms but filled less than half of them. It was prioritizing rooms for homeless people older than 60 or those with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of death should they contract COVID-19.

Breed has resisted calls for a wider policy of providing hotel rooms to all or most of the estimated 8,000 people living on San Francisco's streets or in shelters, saying the logistics would be overwhelming.

But the unanimous vote requiring her to do so came just hours after city health officials released updated figures on a massive coronavirus cluster that infected a majority of the people staying at the city's largest homeless shelter, known as MSC South. More than 100 shelter guests and staff tested positive, and the city's public health director said "many of them have chronic conditions and are vulnerable to getting very sick or even dying."

The outbreak forced city officials to rush shelter residents to hotels where they could self-quarantine, and in the cases of those infected, recover under constant monitoring.

Several members of the Board of Supervisors said the city had failed to heed warnings that "congregate" shelters such as MSC-South were fertile ground for the spread of the virus.

"I am sorry," said Supervisor Dean Preston, addressing shelter residents directly, "that after weeks of warnings, only the confirmed outbreak in your shelters spurred action from all of us."

Advocates for the homeless had been calling on the city to empty its shelters in favor of hotel rooms for weeks.

But until Tuesday's vote, Breed and city health and homelessness officials had been adamant that trying to house all of San Francisco's unhoused people in hotels was impractical, and could be counterproductive.

"It's not as easy as everyone would like to think," Breed said during a media briefing on Monday. She said managing the roughly 750 homeless people the city had already placed in rooms was requiring hundreds of staff to conduct wellness checks and manage behavioral crises, as well as provide transportation and meals.

The mayors of other California cities have expressed similar concerns about the challenge of moving large numbers of homeless people into hotels, even as they've said doing so remains a goal. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said his staff was working to secure more rooms. It had about 1,700 as of this week and was continuing to negotiate with hotel owners.

Though the economic shutdown has left most hotels empty, some owners have refused to offer their properties to house the homeless, leading some advocates to call on mayors to use emergency powers to seize the properties.

Before the outbreak at the homeless shelter, Breed had been widely praised for taking early action to shut down her city — a move seen as largely responsible for San Francisco's success in keeping its rates of coronavirus infection low. But the shelter outbreak has made clear that a poorly managed homeless population could wipe out the city's progress.

"We've done so well in San Francisco on flattening the curve, and there's a lot of concern about what this means if these huge outbreaks occur," said Chris Herring, an advocate for the homeless and doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. "I think what the city is going to soon realize is what the cost of inaction will be." '''

article_8 = ''' San Francisco firefighters battled three separate blazes that sparked in just a 10-minute period Tuesday night, sending three adult victims to the burn center, officials said.

The fires are all under investigation and it’s unclear if they are related, said Jonathan Baxter, a San Francisco Fire Department spokesman.

The first fire — reported at 11:01 p.m. at a home at 625 Girard St. — injured two adults who were taken to the burn center. The blaze was contained by 11:21 p.m.

Four minutes later and 1.4 miles away, a grass fire broke out beneath Highway 101 near 366 Bayshore Blvd., officials said. Northbound traffic on 101 slowed because of the fire, but no structures were damaged. The grass fire was contained at 11:55 p.m. without injuries.

At 11:11 p.m., firefighters responded to a blaze in what they described as “a shed-style structure” near the corner of Wallace Avenue and Ingalls Street, about 1.9 miles from the Bayshore fire and 1.2 miles from the Girard fire. One adult was rescued from the third fire and taken to the burn center. The blaze was contained at 11:53 p.m.  '''

Launching today, the service will use drivers to deliver a variety of essential products, from groceries and meals to cleaning and medical supplies. The ride-hailing service notes the program will be opt-in and derivers will be informed about the nature of the deliveries, which are entirely contact-free.

Lyft previously announced a program to provide funds to drivers who were diagnosed with the virus or otherwise put under quarantine.

The program will be available in a wide range of different markets, including Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Orlando, Phoenix, San Francisco, San Diego, San Antonio and Seattle. New York City, the region with the largest number of coronavirus cases and deaths is not on the initial list. Further markets include North Carolina and Atlanta.

The company is teaming up with local organizations, along with some bigger corporate names like Dole, which is will provide prepackaged foods. The program follows the launch of the LyftUp Driver Community Task Force, an opt-in service asking drivers how they want to pitch in during the crisis. Some 120,000 have signed up. '''

article_10 = '''  VSCO,  the popular photo editing app and Instagram rival, is the latest company to undergo layoffs attributed to the COVID-19 crisis, which has put a strain on venture-backed startups. According to a report from NPR, which was then confirmed by VSCO co-founder and CEO Joel Flory on LinkedIn, the company is laying off around 30% of staff, or 45 of its employees.

Though Flory didn’t reference the COVID-19 outbreak by name, his post described the rapid change to the economy which necessitated the layoffs.

“2020 was staged to be a year where we would continue to forward invest into our business,” Flory wrote. “Overnight our environment changed. We realized that we would need to shift towards running a self-sustaining business.”

In other words, VSCO is anticipating a future where venture capital is less readily available and is making the shift toward running a business that’s no longer reliant on outside capital or funding in order to operate. By laying off a portion of staff, VSCO believes it will be able to sustain its business for many years.

To date, VSCO has raised $90 million in outside funding, and sees its app used by more than 20 million active users per week. However, a smaller portion of those users are customers who pay for a VSCO Membership that offers an expanded array of features, tools, presets and other content. VSCO confirmed to TechCrunch in February 2020 that it had around 2+ million paid subscribers.

Late last year, VSCO had said it was on pace to surpass 4 million paid subscribers by 2020 and was approaching $80 million in annual revenue.

PitchBook data valued the business at $550 million, NPR also reported — a number that’s made the rounds before, as well.



In 2020, VSCO has rolled out several features designed to better support video editing. It gave creators the ability to publish their video edits to the VSCO feed, and last month, for example, launched a more powerful and feature-rich video editing tool called Montage. The latter was meant to grow VSCO’s paid subscriber base, as it requires users to pay in order to save and publish their finished videos.

VSCO’s profile has also been raised beyond its core user base in recent months, after it became associated with a Gen Z meme that circulated on sites like TikTok.

Though perhaps not the marketing the company would have desired, the VSCO girl meme became a way to mock a certain type of girl — one who sports a messy bun, baggy shirts and scrunchies and carries around eco-conscious items like Hydro Flasks or metal straws. VSCO’s app for making your photos look good became associated with this persona, as it’s often used to filter and edit images in order to give them an aesthetic that teenage girls (VSCO girls) supposedly desired.

As for the layoffs, VSCO says its former employees will receive a minimum of seven weeks of severance pay, and a minimum of two months of COBRA health coverage. In terms of equity, VSCO is pro-rating stock option vesting and extending equity exercise periods post-term, it also notes.

Flory’s LinkedIn post additionally offered a way for those interested in hiring the laid-off VSCO employees to reach the company. He said the jobs@vsco.co email address could be used to make inquires about hiring its talent. The company will also be working to provide other job placement resources and support, it says.

“I am deeply saddened to let some incredible people go and am so grateful for everything they’ve done for VSCO and our community,” Flory wrote. “Our mission and vision remain unchanged. Our ability to provide a place for creative expression, inspiration and connection is even more important than ever right now,” he added. '''
